                <div class="description">Gyeongbokgung Castle </div>Gyeongbokgung Palace, located in Seoul, South Korea, was the first royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty, established in 1395. The name "Gyeongbok" translates to "the new dynasty shall have good fortunes and prosper." The palace complex served as the main royal residence for several centuries and is a significant cultural and historical landmark.

                The palace was destroyed during the Japanese invasion in 1592 but was later reconstructed. It features beautiful architecture, including the Gwanghwamun Gate—the main entrance—and the Geunjeongjeon Hall, the throne hall. Visitors can also witness the changing of the guard ceremony, which takes place at the main gate and offers a glimpse into Korea's royal traditions.Gyeongbokgung Palace is surrounded by picturesque mountains and is adjacent to the Blue House, the official residence of the South Korean president. The palace grounds are open to the public, allowing visitors to explore the historic buildings, gardens, and museums that showcase Korea's rich heritage.
