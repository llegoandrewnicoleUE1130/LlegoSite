                The Eiffel Tower (*La Tour Eiffel* in French) is a wrought-iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris. Constructed between 1887 and 1889 as the centerpiece for the Exposition Universelle (World's Fair) celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution, it was initially met with criticism but has since become a global cultural icon and a symbol of France. Standing at approximately 1,083 feet (330 meters), it was the tallest man-made structure in the world until 1930. Today, it attracts millions of visitors annually who come to admire its architectural brilliance and panoramic views of Paris.

I want to experience the charm of Parisian streets, indulge in its world-renowned cuisine, and immerse myself in the art and history that define this iconic city. From strolling along the Seine River to exploring the Louvre, I believe that a visit to Paris would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience that would leave me with unforgettable memories.
